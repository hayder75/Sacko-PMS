## Changes Required

### 1. Add New Product Category Enum

New `ProductCategory` enum with 12 values matching client's plan:

```
Loan_Saving_Deposit
Michu_Current_Saving
Gihon_Regular_Saving
Mothers_Saving
Young_Womens_Saving
Elders_Saving
Children_Saving
Fixed_Time_Deposit
Premium_Saving_Deposit
Special_Saving
Segment_Deposit
Wadiah_IFB_Deposit
```

### 2. Expand KpiCategory Enum

Add product-based KPI categories to match the client's real categories:

```
Loan_Saving_Deposit       -> "Loan Saving Deposit"
Michu_Current_Saving      -> "Michu Current Saving"
Gihon_Regular_Saving      -> "Gihon Regular Saving"
Mothers_Saving            -> "Mothers Saving"
Young_Womens_Saving       -> "Young Womens Saving"
Elders_Saving             -> "Elders Saving"
Children_Saving           -> "Children Saving"
Fixed_Time_Deposit        -> "Fixed Time Deposit"
Premium_Saving_Deposit    -> "Premium Saving Deposit"
Special_Saving            -> "Special Saving"
Segment_Deposit           -> "Segment Deposit"
Wadiah_IFB_Deposit        -> "Wadiah IFB Deposit"
```

### 3. Update Plan Model

Add fields to `Plan` model:
- `product_category ProductCategory?` (new field, alongside existing `kpi_category`)
- `target_count Float @default(0)` (account/number target)
- `monthly_plan Json?` (monthly breakdown — array of 12 months with amount + count targets)

Add fields to `StaffPlan` model:
- `target_count Float @default(0)`
- `monthly_plan Json?`

### 4. Add Missing CBS Product Types

These product types exist in Accounts.csv but are missing from our system:

| Product | Maps To |
|---|---|
| Premium Saving Deposit | Premium_Saving_Deposit |
| Fixed Time Deposit | Fixed_Time_Deposit |
| Wadiah Saving Account | Wadiah_IFB_Deposit |
| Segment Account | Segment_Deposit |
| School | Children_Saving (or new) |

### 5. Update Frontend Product Lists

Update `FALLBACK_PRODUCTS` in `TaskEntryForm.tsx` and static lists in `PlanCascade.tsx`, `ProductMapping.tsx`, `KPIFramework.tsx` to include all product categories.

### 6. Update PlanCascade UI

Redesign PlanCascade to show:
- Product-type targets (per product row with amount + count inputs)
- Monthly breakdown (July→June inline or collapsible)
- Annual totals auto-calculated

### 7. Update PlansOverview

Show per-product breakdown with actual vs target for both amount and count.

### 8. Seed Real Data

- Seed Wolayita Sodo branch with plan targets from XLSX
- Import account mappings from Accounts.csv (557+ accounts)
- Create staff users from Accounts.csv staff references

### 9. Product KPI Mappings

Map all CBS product names to KPI categories:

| CBS Product Name | KPI Category | Product Category |
|---|---|---|

| CHILDREN SAVING ACCOUNT | Deposit Mobilization | Children_Saving |
| FIXED TIME DEPOSIT | Deposit Mobilization | Fixed_Time_Deposit |
| Premium Saving | Deposit Mobilization | Premium_Saving_Deposit |
| SPECIAL SAVING ACCOUNT | Deposit Mobilization | Special_Saving |
| Segment Account | Deposit Mobilization | Segment_Deposit |
| WADIAH SAVING ACCOUNT | Deposit Mobilization | Wadiah_IFB_Deposit |

### Phase 6: Deploy

- [ ] Run `seedWolayitaSodoPlan.js` for product-level plan targets
- [ ] Rebuild and deploy frontend

### Phase 7: Team & Sub-Team Management for Branch Managers

**Goal**: Replicate the Team/Sub-Team management system from `main` branch onto Ghion-Saccos, adapted to our current role/position schema. Branch managers get a `/teams` page to create teams (supervisor-led) and sub-teams (staff-led with members).

**Key Adaptations from `main`**:
- Old role `lineManager` → now `supervisor` (team manager)
- Old role `subTeamLeader` → now any `staff` user (sub-team leader, flexible)
- Old role `staff` → same `staff` (sub-team members)
- Team & SubTeam Prisma models added back to schema
- isBranchManager middleware already exists and allows admin/areaManager/branchManager/supervisor

**Backend Tasks**:
- [x] Add Team + SubTeam models to Prisma schema with User ↔ Team/SubTeam relations
- [x] Create and apply Prisma migration (`20260714222048_add_team_subteam_models`)
- [x] Create `teamController.js` — CRUD for Team & SubTeam (adapted: supervisor role for manager, staff for leader/members)
- [x] Create `teamRoutes.js` — routes protected by isBranchManager
- [x] Register routes in `server.js`

**Frontend Tasks**:
- [x] Add `teamsAPI` and `subTeamsAPI` to `api.ts`
- [x] Create `TeamManagement.tsx` — form to create Team (name, code, assign supervisor as manager) + SubTeam (name, code, pick team, assign leader, pick member checkboxes)
- [x] Add route `/teams` in App.tsx for branchManager
- [x] Add sidebar "TEAM MANAGEMENT" link for branchManager

**Testing & Verification**:
- [x] Backend tests pass (all 118 passing)
- [x] Frontend builds clean (tsc + vite build)
- [x] API verified: branch manager can create teams with supervisor (Kidistale assigned as manager of "Wolayta Team A")
- [x] API verified: branch manager can create sub-teams with leader + members (Meron as leader, Tezera & Yaredabebe as members)
- [x] Team query verified: full relation chain works (Team → SubTeam → Leader → Members)
- [x] Supervisor dashboard already shows team members via supervisorId (no change needed)
- [x] Branch manager dashboard already shows all staff performance (no change needed)
