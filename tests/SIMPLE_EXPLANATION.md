# SAKO PMS - Simple Explanation (Non-Finance Terms)

## What This System Does (In Simple Words)

Think of this like a **work tracking and performance system** for a company with many branches and employees.

---

## The Big Picture

**Imagine a company with:**
- 1 Main Office (HQ)
- Multiple Regions (like North, South, East)
- Each Region has Areas
- Each Area has Branches (like store locations)
- Each Branch has Employees

**The Problem:** How do you:
1. Set goals for everyone?
2. Track what work they do each day?
3. Know if they're doing a good job?
4. Pay them bonuses based on performance?

**The Solution:** This PMS system!

## How It Works - Step by Step

### STEP 1: Set Up the Company Structure
**Like building an organization chart**

- **HQ Admin** creates the big bosses (Regional Directors, Area Managers, Branch Managers)
- **Branch Manager** creates team leaders (Line Managers, Sub-Team Leaders)
- **Sub-Team Leader** creates regular employees (Staff)

**Think of it like:** 
- CEO hires managers
- Managers hire supervisors  
- Supervisors hire workers

---

### STEP 2: Set Goals for Everyone
**Like giving everyone a target to hit**

- **HQ Admin** uploads a file saying: "This year, we want to collect 100 million Birr in deposits"
- **System automatically splits it:**
  - Region gets 30 million
  - Area gets 10 million
  - Branch gets 5 million
  - Each Staff person gets 2.5 million (their share)

**Think of it like:** 
- Company says "We want 1000 sales this year"
- System divides: Branch A gets 200, Branch B gets 300, etc.
- Each salesperson gets their portion

---

### STEP 3: Assign Customers to Employees
**Like giving each employee a list of customers to work with**

- **Branch Manager** assigns customer accounts to staff
- Example: "Employee A, you handle customers 1-50. Employee B, you handle 51-100"
- OR use "Auto-Balance" to split evenly

**Why?** So when an employee does work, we know which customers count for them.

**Think of it like:**
- A pizza delivery manager assigns delivery zones to drivers
- Driver A gets North zone, Driver B gets South zone
- When they deliver, it counts toward their zone

---

### STEP 4: Employees Log Their Daily Work
**Like a daily work diary**

**Employee does work:**
- Collects money from a customer
- Opens a new account
- Helps customer use mobile banking
- Registers a new member

**Employee logs it in the system:**
- "Today I collected 50,000 Birr from customer ABC123"
- "Today I opened 3 new accounts"
- "Today I activated 2 mobile banking accounts"

**System checks:**
- ✅ Is this customer assigned to you? → "Yes, it counts!"
- ❌ Is this customer assigned to someone else? → "Needs approval"
- ❌ Is this customer not assigned? → "Needs manager to assign first"

**Think of it like:**
- A delivery driver logs: "I delivered 10 pizzas today"
- System checks: "Were those in your assigned zone?" 
- If yes → counts toward your goal
- If no → needs manager approval

---

### STEP 5: Manager Approves the Work
**Like a manager checking and signing off**

**Work goes through approval chain:**
1. Employee submits → "I did this work"
2. Sub-Team Leader checks → "Looks good, I approve"
3. Line Manager checks → "I approve"
4. Branch Manager checks → "Final approval"

**Only approved work counts toward performance!**

**Think of it like:**
- Employee: "I sold 10 items"
- Supervisor: "Let me verify... yes, approved"
- Manager: "Final check... approved"
- Now it counts toward sales goal

---

### STEP 6: Verify Against Bank Records
**Like double-checking with the bank statement**

- **Next morning**, HQ uploads bank's daily transaction file
- **System compares:**
  - "Employee said they collected 50,000 Birr"
  - "Bank shows 50,000 Birr was deposited"
  - ✅ **Match!** → Verified, counts for sure
  - ❌ **Mismatch!** → Flagged for review

**Think of it like:**
- Employee: "I collected $1000"
- Bank statement: "We received $1000"
- Match = Verified!
- No match = Problem to fix

---

### STEP 7: Calculate Performance Score
**Like giving a grade**

**Two parts:**

**Part 1: Work Performance (85% of grade)**
- Did you hit your goals?
- Example: Goal was 2.5 million, you collected 2.1 million = 84%
- This is 85% of your final score

**Part 2: Behavior Score (15% of grade)**
- How well do you work with others?
- Are you reliable? Good communication?
- Manager rates you 1-5 on 8 different skills
- This is 15% of your final score

**Final Score = Work (85%) + Behavior (15%)**

**Example:**
- Work Score: 84% × 85% = 71.4 points
- Behavior Score: 90% × 15% = 13.5 points
- **Final = 84.9%** → Rating: "Very Good" ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Think of it like:**
- School grade: 85% from tests + 15% from participation = Final Grade
- A+ (90%+), A (80-89%), B (70-79%), C (60-69%), F (<60%)

---

### STEP 8: See Results on Dashboard
**Like a report card that updates in real-time**

**Each person sees:**
- Their goals
- How much they've done
- How much left to do
- Their current grade/rating
- Their rank in the team

**Managers see:**
- Their whole team's performance
- Who's doing well (green)
- Who needs help (red)
- Who has work waiting for approval

**HQ sees:**
- All branches
- Which branches are doing best
- Which need attention
- Overall company performance

**Think of it like:**
- Employee dashboard = Your personal report card
- Manager dashboard = Class report showing all students
- HQ dashboard = School report showing all classes

## Real-World Example

**Let's say you're a Staff member (Employee):**

1. **Monday Morning:**
   - You log in → See your dashboard
   - Your goal: Collect 2.5 million Birr this month
   - You've done: 1.8 million so far (72% done)
   - Rank: #3 out of 12 employees

2. **Monday - You Do Work:**
   - Customer comes in, deposits 50,000 Birr
   - You log: "Deposit Mobilization, Account ABC123, 50,000 Birr"
   - System says: ✅ "Mapped to You" - counts!

3. **Monday Evening:**
   - Your Sub-Team Leader approves your task
   - Line Manager approves
   - Branch Manager approves
   - Task status: ✅ Approved

4. **Tuesday Morning:**
   - HQ uploads bank file
   - System checks: "Did bank receive 50,000 from ABC123?"
   - ✅ Yes! → Task verified
   - Your performance score updates: Now 73% done

5. **End of Month:**
   - System calculates: You did 2.2 million out of 2.5 million = 88%
   - Manager rates your behavior: 4.5/5 = 90%
   - Final Score: (88% × 85%) + (90% × 15%) = 88.3%
   - Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ "Very Good"
   - You get bonus based on this!

## Key Concepts Made Simple

**"Plan Cascade"** = Breaking big company goal into smaller goals for each person
- Like: "Company wants 1000 sales" → "You need to make 50 sales"

**"Account Mapping"** = Assigning customers to employees
- Like: "You handle customers 1-50, I handle 51-100"

**"Daily Tasks"** = Logging what work you did today
- Like: "I sold 5 items today"

**"Approval Chain"** = Multiple people checking your work is correct
- Like: Supervisor checks → Manager checks → Final approval

**"CBS Validation"** = Checking your work matches bank records
- Like: "You said you collected $100, bank shows $100" → Verified!

**"KPI Score"** = How well you did on your work goals
- Like: "Goal was 100, you did 85" = 85% score

**"Behavioral Score"** = How well you work with others
- Like: "Are you reliable? Good team player? Good communication?"

**"Final Score"** = Your overall performance grade
- Like: School grade combining tests + participation
