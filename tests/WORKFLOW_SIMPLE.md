# 🎯 SAKO PMS - Simple Workflow (What Actually Happens)

## Think of This Like a School System

**Instead of students and teachers, we have employees and managers.**

---

## 📚 PART 1: SETTING UP THE SCHOOL (Company Structure)

### What Happens:
1. **Principal (HQ Admin)** creates the school structure
2. **Vice Principals (Branch Managers)** create department heads
3. **Department Heads (Sub-Team Leaders)** create teachers
4. **Teachers (Staff)** are the workers

### In the System:
- **HQ Admin** → Creates Branch Managers
- **Branch Manager** → Creates Line Managers and Sub-Team Leaders  
- **Sub-Team Leader** → Creates Staff (5-6 employees)

**Result:** Everyone has an account and knows who their boss is.

---

## 🎯 PART 2: SETTING GOALS (Plan Upload)

### What Happens:
**Principal says:** "This year, our school needs 1000 new students"

**System automatically divides:**
- North Campus: 300 students
- South Campus: 400 students  
- East Campus: 300 students

**Then divides further:**
- Each teacher gets: 50 students (their share)

### In the System:
- **HQ Admin** uploads Excel file with company goals
- System splits it: Region → Area → Branch → Each Employee
- Each employee gets their portion (like 2.5 million Birr deposit target)

**Result:** Everyone knows their target for the month/year.

---

## 👥 PART 3: ASSIGNING CUSTOMERS (Account Mapping)

### What Happens:
**Manager says:** "Teacher A, you handle students 1-50. Teacher B, you handle 51-100"

### In the System:
- **Branch Manager** assigns customer accounts to staff
- OR clicks "Auto-Balance" to split evenly
- Example: 100 customers, 4 staff = 25 customers each

**Result:** Each employee knows which customers are "theirs"

---

## 📝 PART 4: LOGGING DAILY WORK (Task Entry)

### What Happens:
**Teacher logs:** "Today I taught 5 classes, graded 20 papers"

### In the System:
**Employee logs:** "Today I collected 50,000 Birr from customer ABC123"

**System checks:**
- ✅ Is customer ABC123 assigned to you? → YES → Counts!
- ❌ Is customer ABC123 assigned to someone else? → Needs approval
- ❌ Is customer ABC123 not assigned? → Manager must assign first

**Result:** Work is logged and waiting for approval.

---

## ✅ PART 5: APPROVING WORK (Approval Chain)

### What Happens:
**Like a teacher's work being checked:**
1. Teacher submits work
2. Department Head checks it
3. Vice Principal checks it
4. Principal final approval

### In the System:
1. **Staff submits** task
2. **Sub-Team Leader** approves
3. **Line Manager** approves  
4. **Branch Manager** final approval

**Only approved work counts toward your score!**

**Result:** Work is verified and counts toward performance.

---

## 🏦 PART 6: VERIFYING WITH BANK (CBS Validation)

### What Happens:
**Like checking your bank statement matches your records**

**Next morning:**
- Bank sends file: "We received these deposits yesterday"
- System compares: "Employee said they collected X, bank shows X"
- ✅ Match = Verified!
- ❌ No match = Problem to investigate

### In the System:
- **HQ Admin** uploads bank's daily transaction file
- System automatically matches tasks with bank records
- Only verified tasks count for final score

**Result:** Prevents fake work entries, ensures accuracy.

---

## 📊 PART 7: CALCULATING GRADES (Performance Score)

### What Happens:
**Like a school report card with two parts:**

**Part 1: Test Scores (85% of grade)**
- Did you hit your goals?
- Goal: 2.5 million, You did: 2.1 million = 84%

**Part 2: Participation (15% of grade)**
- Are you reliable? Good team player?
- Manager rates you 1-5 on skills

**Final Grade:**
- Test (84% × 85%) + Participation (90% × 15%) = 84.9%
- Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ "Very Good"

### In the System:
- **KPI Score (85%):** How well you did on work goals
- **Behavioral Score (15%):** How well you work with others
- **Final Score** = Both combined
- **Rating:** Outstanding / Very Good / Good / Needs Support / Unsatisfactory

**Result:** Everyone gets a performance grade.

---

## 📱 PART 8: SEEING RESULTS (Dashboards)

### What Happens:
**Like checking your grades online**

**Employee sees:**
- My goals
- How much I've done
- How much left
- My current grade
- My rank in team

**Manager sees:**
- All team members' performance
- Who's doing well (green)
- Who needs help (red)
- Work waiting for approval

**HQ sees:**
- All branches
- Which branches are best
- Which need attention

**Result:** Real-time visibility of everyone's performance.

## 💡 REAL EXAMPLE

**You're a Staff member:**

**Monday:**
- Login → See: "Goal: 2.5M, Done: 1.8M (72%)"
- Customer deposits 50,000 Birr
- You log: "Deposit, Account ABC123, 50,000"
- System: ✅ "Mapped to You" - counts!

**Tuesday:**
- Your manager approves your Monday task

- Your score updates: Now 73% done

**End of Month:**
- You did 2.2M out of 2.5M = 88%
- Manager rates behavior: 90%
- Final: (88% × 85%) + (90% × 15%) = 88.3%
- Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ "Very Good"
- You get bonus!
