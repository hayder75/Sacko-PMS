## Frontend

The frontend is a React application built with:
- React 19 + TypeScript
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui components
- Recharts for data visualization
- React Router for navigation

### Running the Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

See `frontend/README.md` for detailed frontend documentation.

## Backend

Backend API will be built here (coming soon).

## Development

1. **Frontend Development**: Navigate to `frontend/` directory
2. **Backend Development**: Backend will be set up in the root or `backend/` directory

## Notes

- Frontend uses mock data (no API integration yet)
- Role-based access control is implemented in the frontend
- All routes and navigation are documented in `frontend/ROUTES.md`
